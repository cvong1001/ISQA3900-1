        <h1> Travels in the last year </h1>
        <p>

        Spring 2017, I was not happy of where I was at in life and felt like something was missing.
        After hearing of studying abroad for the last three years, I finally decided to go to to the study abroad advisor Emily.
        She was able to tell me a lot of information about UNO's exchange program and how I would be able to fund the program.
        After researching for a few days, I decided that my first study abroad program would be in Japan! The reason why I decided Japan was because I have
        been always fascinated about the culture. I love anime and my favorite food is ramen, so it was an obvious choice to pick Japan.

        <p>
        After my Japan program, I decided to do another study abroad program in another country. I decided I wanted to study somewhere input
        Europe so I could compare and see how different Japanese culture is to European culture. At first I was leaning towards Norway, but it was an
        expensive place to live and financially I could not afford it. This led to me picking a country in Eastern Europe which was Hungary. I decided Hungary due to
        the cost of living and actually having a friend who is Hungarian that I met in Japan.

        During my program in Hungary, I started traveling around Europe. By the end of the Hungary program, I traveled to Solvenia, Croatia, France, Iceland, Norway, Netherlands, and Italy.
        After leaving Europe, I went back to Asia and was able to travel to South Korea and China for a month. After a year of traveling, I finally returned to home and prepared for my Fall 2018 semester.
        After this semester, I traveled back to Europe for winter break to have a reunion with my friends I met while traveling for a year. During these 2 weeks, I was able to travel to a few more new countries like Austria, Belgium, and Germany.

        <p>
        After graduation, I am hoping to continue traveling to learn more about the world. I find traveling a thrill because you never know what will happen or what opportunities that may unfold.
